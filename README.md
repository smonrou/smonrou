- Hello, I'm @Smonrou or Saúl, whatever you want to call me.
- 👀 I'm an Android developer, at university I learned to program c++ and Java, I am currently focused on the development of mobile apps.
- 🌱 I learned Kotlin very quickly and today I think I have a Mid level in Android development
- 💞️ I am currently developing a mobile app from scratch, today I am already very advanced, because I continue studying and because I must update my knowledge at all times and learn things as I go, I estimate that finishing this project will take me 6 more months. Since I am the developer, designer, I am the one who corrects the code, I manage the database, the storage of the app. I am the only person who works on it, I am learning a little about everything.
- 📫 You can contact me on my social networks, mainly Instagram @smonroy_18
- ⚡ Fun fact: I decided to learn a little Kotlin, I started a small project that was supposed to last 12 hours, somehow it escalated and I've been working on it for 6 months.
